> **Note:** I have been out of touch from react from past 2 years. And react has evolved a lot since then, so below suggestion are more from my fundamental understanding about Javascript and frontend frameworks.

## I belive there are 3 factors which largely effects the Scalebility of frontend application -
1. STATE MANAGEMENT - One of the things that can get really messy in a large scale application is STATE management, and I am not at liking the way I have managed state in this excercise. Partly because I am still diggesting react hooks. So I would really like to bring redux or redux like store with actions which can be accessed within any components, specially to handle the backend API calls. 
2. CONTROL FLOW - Although the application structure feels okay now and readable. But I think this can easly get complicated as we include featers and more screens. So may be breaking it into more reusable chunks and which can also be more test friendly which can give us confidence on the codebase as it becomes feature rich.
3. CODE VOLUME - I think on this aspect it is pretty decent as I am not relying on many libraries.

There is a lot and lots of scope for CSS to be made more managebale and adding some css preprocessor. For now I have just used my own generic css classes.
