# Suggestions

- Test design could be mocked up if the test is focused on react.
- I would evaluate subjects only once, for example making requests, arranging a website could be done once instead of developing multiple pages, that would provide me enough information for the new hire about his skill set (of course afterwards I would always interrogate him on what he did and why he made some choices to verify he did the take home challenge)
- About the application, we could implement changes a detailed error on the test reports, that points out on the possible solution or cause of the error.
- Sorting the test reports by POST, PUT, GET, ETC.
