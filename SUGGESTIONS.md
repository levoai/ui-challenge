# It'd be great to use TailwindCSS. Because, it provides fast speed and clear css architecture.
If the design is similar to existing theme like material-ui, then this isn't a must, but if the design has lots of different colors, font sizes, etc, then tailwind would be better.

# It'd be great to use redux later.
If we use redux, then there won't be much communication between components.
Also redux state can be always seen in the browser, so we can see bugs and status of the project everytime.

# I think, the current wireframe looks good because the user can easily know which button he has to click.
