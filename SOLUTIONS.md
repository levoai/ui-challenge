Because of time constrain I focused on functionality over aesthetics

I created a solution using routing because it will be needed to access directly a report or an organization easly 

I used bootstrap and react-bootstrap to boost the development

I tried not to use context or store because I thought it was overkill for this APP, had more weight in the decision to keed the less clutter as possible

I was planning to create an util to handle dates, it can be easly added in the future

Layout and CSS in general wasn't as polish as I would want because of time constraint
